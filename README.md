# get_next_line
The get_next_line function should read a text file pointed to by a file descriptor, one line at a time. The function should return the line that was read, including the terminating \n character.
unless the end of the file was reached and it does not end with a \n character. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurs, the function should return NULL. The function should work as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
